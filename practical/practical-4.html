      interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext
      Markup Language(HTML),Cascading Style Sheets(CSS), and Java Script portion
      of web site production as opposed to the database or server-side
      programming. It encompasses everything from building a siple page of HTML
      text to creating coplex,responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accesses
      via various different browsers,devices and screen sizes.
