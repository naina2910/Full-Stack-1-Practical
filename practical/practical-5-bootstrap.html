      Bootstrap is a free and open-source framework for creating websites and
      web applications. It's the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for
      developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. As the web
      evolves more and more toward responsive design, it can be a real challenge
      for web developers to keep up. Bootstrap can make things a whole lot
      easier. Bootstrap enables you to create responsive websites without you
      needing to do the "responsive" bit. Bootstrap takes care of that.
      Bootstrap is promoted as being One framework, every device. This is
      because websites built with Bootstrap will automatically scale between
      devices â€” whether the device is a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop
      computer, screen reader, etc.Not only is Bootstrap responsive, it is
      mobile-first. This means that it is primarily designed for mobile devices,
      then scales up from there (as opposed to being designed for desktop, then
      trying to scale it down to mobile devices).
