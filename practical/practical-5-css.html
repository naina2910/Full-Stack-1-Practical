      Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design
      language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
      CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can
      control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between
      paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or
      colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different
      devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects. CSS is
      easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the
      presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the
      markup languages HTML or XHTML.
