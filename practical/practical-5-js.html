      JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript
      is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage.
      In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive,
      with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game
      development and Mobile application development. The language was initially
      called LiveScript and was later renamed JavaScript. There are many
      programmers who think that JavaScript and Java are the same. In fact,
      JavaScript and Java are very much unrelated. Java is a very complex
      programming language whereas JavaScript is only a scripting language. The
      syntax of JavaScript is mostly influenced by the programming language C.
